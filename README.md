# Computer Engineering

Computer Engineering students who started **in 2014** (Program code [3645](http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/programs/2014/3645.html) / started with my cohort) used to have a prescribed list of electives. The list was unmaintained, listing many courses which did not run anymore and not including any new ones. This repo used to host a sorted list of what was running and what wasn't.

**As of 2017 Semester 1, the school student office advises that this list of electives no longer exists**.

Hooray!

In replacement of the old elective list, use the new Computer Engineering program guidelines for electives: 

### Breadth electives

Complete 4 of any courses which have the course code COMP3xxx or above

### Depth electives

Complete 4 of any courses which have the course code COMP4xxx or above
