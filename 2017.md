# Computer Engineering

2017 elective options

**WARNING** Only applies to *Computer Engineering* students who started in 2014 (i.e. started with my cohort) (http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/programs/2014/3645.html).

Note: COMP3211 isn't really a breadth elective as it is core - yes, another one of /those/ courses.
